Feedforward Network: 

The FeedForward class in the code represents a simple feedforward neural network. It takes the number of embedding dimensions (n_embd) as an argument and defines a sequential neural network with two linear layers, a ReLU activation function, and a dropout layer.

The first linear layer projects the input to a higher dimensional space, and the ReLU activation function applies a non-linearity to the output. The dropout layer randomly drops some of the activations to prevent overfitting. Finally, the second linear layer projects the output back to the original dimensionality.

Overall, the FeedForward class is used as part of the Transformer block to transform the output of the self-attention layer before passing it to the next layer in the network.
