#The training loop in the code is the main part of the program that trains the Transformer model. 
#It runs for a fixed number of iterations specified by the max_iters hyperparameter. During each iteration, the loop performs the following steps:

    #Gets a batch of input data and target output data using the get_batch function. The size of the batch is specified by the batch_size hyperparameter.

    #Sends the input and target data to the GPU if available.

    #Resets the gradients of the model parameters.

    #Computes the forward pass of the model on the input data.

    #Calculates the loss between the model's output and the target data using the estimate_loss function.

    #Computes the gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters using backpropagation.

    #Updates the model parameters using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the learning rate specified by the learning_rate hyperparameter.

    #Periodically evaluates the model on the validation dataset at intervals specified by the eval_interval hyperparameter.

#After the training loop finishes, the final model parameters are saved to a file named 'model.pth'.
