The transformer block is the basic building block of the transformer model. The code defines a class, Block, which represents a transformer block. The block contains two sub-layers: a multi-head attention layer and a feedforward layer. Each sub-layer is followed by a layer normalization step, which helps to stabilize the training process.

The Block class takes the following arguments:

    n_embd: The number of embedding dimensions.
    n_head: The number of attention heads.
    dropout: The dropout rate.
    block_size: The maximum block size.

The Block class has the following methods:

    forward(x): This method takes an input tensor x of shape (batch_size, block_size, n_embd) and passes it through the multi-head attention and feedforward layers, followed by layer normalization. The output of the layer is returned.

The Block class is used to create the encoder and decoder layers of the transformer model.
