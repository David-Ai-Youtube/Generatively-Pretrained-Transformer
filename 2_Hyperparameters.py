#Hyperparameters:

#Hyperparameters are values that define the structure and behavior of a machine learning model, but are not learned during the training process. 
#They are set by the user prior to training and can greatly impact the performance of the model.

#In this code, several hyperparameters are initialized:


    batch_size: the number of examples in each batch used during training
    block_size: the length of input sequence fed into the model
    max_iters: the maximum number of iterations to train the model
    eval_interval: the number of iterations between evaluating the model on the validation set
    learning_rate: the step size used in the optimization algorithm (in this case, stochastic gradient descent)
    device: the device on which the model will be trained (e.g. "cpu" or "cuda" for a GPU)
    eval_iters: the number of iterations used to estimate the validation loss
    n_embd: the dimensionality of the embedding layer in the model
    n_head: the number of self-attention heads in the multi-head attention layer of the model
    n_layer: the number of transformer blocks in the model
    dropout: the dropout probability used in the model for regularization


#By setting these hyperparameters, the code can be customized to the specific requirements of the task and the available resources. 
#Choosing appropriate hyperparameters is crucial for achieving good performance in a machine learning model.
