#After training the model for a certain number of iterations, the code evaluates the model's performance on both the training and validation datasets using the estimate_loss function. 
#This function computes the average loss across all batches of the dataset, where the loss is computed as the negative log-likelihood of the target sequence given the input sequence.

#The evaluation is performed every eval_interval iterations, which is a hyperparameter set at the beginning of the script. 
#During each evaluation, the function prints the average loss for both the training and validation datasets.

#This evaluation allows the user to monitor the model's progress over time and detect any signs of overfitting or underfitting. 
#If the training loss is significantly lower than the validation loss, it suggests that the model is overfitting to the training data and may not generalize well to new data. 
#In this case, one can consider reducing the model's capacity or introducing regularization techniques such as dropout. 
#If both the training and validation losses are high, it suggests that the model is underfitting and may benefit from increasing its capacity or adjusting the hyperparameters.
