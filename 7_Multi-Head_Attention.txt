Multi-Head Attention: 

The MultiHeadAttention class is a building block for the Transformer model. It represents the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to attend to different parts of the input simultaneously. The class takes two arguments: num_heads, which specifies the number of attention heads to use, and head_size, which specifies the size of each attention head.

The class first creates a list of Head instances, one for each attention head. Each Head instance is initialized with the head_size argument, and has its own set of query, key, and value linear layers.

During the forward pass, the input is split into num_heads parts, each of which is processed by a different Head instance. The output from each head is concatenated and projected using a linear layer called proj. The output is then passed through a dropout layer before being returned.
